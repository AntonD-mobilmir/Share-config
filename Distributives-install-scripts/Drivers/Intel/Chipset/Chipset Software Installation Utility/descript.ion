An INF is a text file that provides the operating system with information about a piece of hardware on the system. In the case of the current Intel Chipset Device Software, that information is primarily the product name for the piece of hardware. This allows the operating system to show the correct name for that piece of hardware in Device Manager.\n\n**Important**\nThe Intel Chipset Device Software does not install drivers for AGP or USB. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS UTILITY IF YOUR DEVICE MANUFACTURER IS RECOMMENDING IT TO CORRECT AN "AGP DRIVER," "AGP GART," OR "USB DRIVER" ISSUE; IT WILL NOT CORRECT YOUR ISSUE.\nThis download is valid for the product(s) listed below.\nIntel® 852/855 Chipset Family\nIntel® 915GV Express Chipset (embedded)\nIntel® 945G Express Chipset (embedded)\nIntel® Chipset Software Installation Utility\nIntel® NM10 Express Chipset\nIntel® Q35 Express Chipset (embedded)\nIntel® Q45 Express Chipset (embedded)\nIntel® Q965 Express Chipset (embedded)\nMobile Intel® 4 Series Express Chipset Family\nMobile Intel® 915GME Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® 945GME Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® 945GSE Express Chipset (embedded)\nMobile Intel® 965 Express Chipset Family\nMobile Intel® GM45 Express Chipset (embedded)\nMobile Intel® GME965 Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® HM55 Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® HM57 Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® QM57 Express Chipset\nMobile Intel® QS57 Express ChipsetÂ
