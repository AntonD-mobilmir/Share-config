40, V0.48:   2009-07-26

Modifications from V0.47:

    1, Acronis TrueImage compatible issue solved:
       Verified with Acronis True Image Home 2009. Also verified with
       FreeOFTE 3.0, TrueCrypt 6.2a.
    2, Driver code-signed for Vista and Server 2008
    3, Code improvements for FastIo routines and drive letter & mount
       points management

39, V0.47:   2009-06-01

Modifications from V0.46:

    1, Bo Branten's 5+ patches merged, lots ifstest failures resolved
    2, Mount point automatic assignment for USB key and other removable
       disks or removable media devices

38, V0.46:   2008-05-24

Modifications from V0.46:

    1, ext3 journal check and replay implemented. If the journal is
       not empty ext2fsd will replay the journal and make the file
       system consistent as an ext2 file system.
    2, flexible-inode-size supported. recent Linux are using 256-byte
       inode that fails 0.45 and before to show all the files.
    3, FIXME: 2 minor issues that mislead EditPlus. EditPlus is always
       trying to open any file with directory_only flag set to judge
       whether the target is a directory or file, when the file isn't
       a directory, the open request should be denied. But Ext2Fsd 0.45
       and before doesn't. Another issue is that ext2 file time on disk
       has different precision against windows (1 second vs 100 nano
       second), which causes EditPlus thinks the file is being changed.
    4, FIXME: a severe bug (likely happen on win2k system) which cause
       dirty caches missed and slow down the whole system. 
    5, many other minor changes: bulk block allocation/release, possible
       inode allocation dead-loop when all inodes are used out, Ext2Mgr
       win2k support, other performance improvements.

37, V0.45:   2008-02-19

Modifications from V0.44:

    1, set hidden attribute for all files starting with "."
    2, update cache window size when writing to file end
    3, reaper resources allocated during file creation

36, V0.44:   2008-02-09

Modifications from V0.43:

    1, Ext2Fsd: LastWriteTime/LastAccessTime update
    2, Ext2Mgr: Show driver/app versions in About dialog

35, V0.43:   2008-02-01

Modifications from V0.42:

    1, Ext2Fsd: hidden/system attribute handling
    2, Ext2Mgr: Added manifest to cope with UAC

34, V0.42:   2008-01-26

Features implemented:
    1, Mountpoint auto mount/removal supported for removable disks

33, V0.41:   2008-01-25

Modifications from V0.40:

Bugs/Problems Fixed:

    1,  Some files couldn't be shown in explorer with utf8 codepage
    2,  System always pops "device is busy" when removing USB disks

Features implemented:

    1, Ext2Fsd: Updated codepage encodings to latest Linux kernel
    2, Ext2Mgr: Added Chinese translation which is in high demand
                Enhanced mountpoints management for removable devices

32, V0.40:   2008-01-13

Modifications from V0.39

Bugs/Problems Fixed:

    1,  Directory inode isn't freed after directory deletion
    2,  Retrieval pointers implemented for extents mapping
    3,  Correct the handling of STATUS_CANT_WAIT. Vista's Cache
        Manager often fails us on PingRead when copying bunch of
        files/directories from ext2 volumes, and thus it results
        in zero-data-content in copied files
    4,  Optimize space allocation to minimize fragments

31, V0.39:   2008-01-09

Modifications from V0.38

  Bugs Fixed:

    1, Disk space isn't released after deleting big files larger than
       (BLOCK_SIZE * (12 + BLOCK_SIZE/4 + BLOCK_SIZE * BLOCK_SIZE / 16))
       That's 4,299,210,752 in case BLOCK_SIZE is 4096.

30, V0.38:   2008-01-04

Modifications from V0.37

  Bugs Fixed:

     1, File block extents management improved to decrease CPU usage
     2, Re-queue request when cache manager can't prepare pages in time
     3, Possible deletion of it's hardlink entry when removing a file
     4, Prohibit to create file with same names to dead symlinks
     5, Wrong inode type in directory entry for symbol links
     6, Possible memory leak when failed to overwrite file
     7, Memory leak in Ext2FreeMcb, it's counted but not freed.
     8, Possible loss of inode/dentry update: Ext2WriteVolume might
        miss the dirty windows with SECTOR_SIZE aligned borders
     9, SpinLock related routines shouldn't be resident in paged zone
    10, Possible lost of files in directory listing

29, V0.37:   2007-12-25

  Bugs Fixed:

      1, files >=4G couldn't be copy&paste to ext2 volume, caused by a hardcode
         limit in Ext2CreateFile
      2, failure of "No enough memory" when renaming files under directories
         it likely happens when renaming files under subdirectory with Samba
         or Linux kernel CIFS.
      3, possible deadlock in renaming with simultaneous access on the same file
      4, possible wrong entry (hardlinks) deletion instead of itself: it's
         rare to happen but possible when renaming, moving or deleting files. 
      5, entry management routines enhancement 
      6, 64k-block support

      3, "." and ".." are treated as separate inodes
      4, remove unnecessary local variables to reduce stack
         overflow chances especially for nested symlinks
      5, overall optimizations on block allocation/release/mapping 
      6, non-consistent Mcb reference issue (broken by symlinks)
      7, memory leaks of BLOCK_DATA when expanding file
      8, buffer overflow in Ext2Printf only for checked build

      2, wrong message box poped when setting service property
      3, more partition types recognized

    Bugs Fixed:
      1, Fsck error reports: "inode is in use, but has dtime set." for
         deleted directories. This bug caused by non-zero i_links_count
         of deleted directory inode.
      2, When many files (Normally > 255 files, reported by Zhoujingg)
         are deleted, the dir entry may cross blocks, which will cause
         ext2/ext3 driver could not correctly read the directory entries.

17, V0.21:  2004-06-09

    Bugs Fixed:
      1, Ext2Flush does not complete the IRP for READ_ONLY mode.
      2, Delayed close tries to refer completed Irps.
      3, Directory content does NOT ends with zero-inode entry. Ext2ScanDir
         and Ext2QueryDirectory do a wrong way to enum entries. Thanks to 
         "Bomb" <bomb_hero@163.com>
      4, Ext2MountVolume still returns STATUS_SUCCESS for non-ext2 volumes.
      5, Ext2SetRenameInfo always treats "Rename" as "Move"

======================
 Bugs
======================

(Nobody can expect that ext2fsd is bug-free.)
Any bugs, please mail to me.


======================
 How to install
======================

1, Build this project, and ext2fsd.sys will be created.
2, Copy ext2fsd.sys to %system32%\drivers.
3, Import the ext2fsd.reg into your system registry.
4, After rebooting your machine, run "net start ext2fsd" at a dos shell.
5, Use mount/unmount tools to mount or unmount a disk partition.
6, You can unload ext2fsd from system with unload tool.

After version 0.10, these is an easy way:

1, Just run "Setup.bat" in "Setup" subdir for the first time. Then just
   run "net start ext2fsd" in a dos shell to start the driver.

      After v0.23, you need specify your system version:

        setup 2k: to install ext2fsd for windows 200
        setup xp: to install ext2fsd for windows xp


2, Then you can mount the ext2 partitions without rebooting.


======================
 How to uninstall
======================

1, Just run uninstall.bat in the Ext2Fsd.zip package.
   .OR.
2, Use the "Add/Remove Programs" in "Control Panel", click the item of
   "linux ext2 file system driver" to remove the program.
   .OR.
3, Manually remove the ext2fsd projects files. 
   a) Remove the registry: HKLM\...\Ext2Fsd & Uninstall ...
   b) Remove Mount.exe/Mke2fs.exe from $(SystemRoot)\system32
   c) Remove Ext2Fsd.sys from $(SystemRoot)\system32\drivers
   d) Remove ext2fsd.inf from $(SystemRoot)\inf


======================
 Writing support
======================

Two ways are optional to enable writing support.

1, Change the value of "Parameters\WritingSupport" in ext2fsd.reg to 1, then
   import the reg file into system registry.
   Or modify the registry directly. Like this:

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Ext2Fsd\Parameters]
   "WritingSupport"=dword:00000001
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Notes: Reboot is need.

   Or

2, Change the definition of EXT2_READ_ONLY to 0, and recompile ext2fsd, then
   overwrite the original one. (See line 27 in ext2fs.h)


Please refer FAQ.txt for more information.
