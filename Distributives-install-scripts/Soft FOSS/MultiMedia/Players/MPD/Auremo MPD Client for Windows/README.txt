What to download:
-----------------

Auremo-x.y.z-installer.exe: this is the standard installer package. If you
want to run Auremo, this is probably what you want to download.

Auremo-x.y.z-executable.zip: inside this zip is a standalone executable
without an installer. Most people will likely want to get the installer
instead, but this might be useful if you want to run Auremo without
installing it, run it from a USB memory stick, etc.

Auremo-x.y.z-src.zip: inside this zip are the source code and companion
files needed to build Auremo. It can be built with e.g.
Microsoft Visual Studio Express, which is available free of charge.


Why these files are here instead of Google Code:
------------------------------------------------

This is the official Auremo download site as of 26th September 2013.
Until the end of 2013 you can find also the stable releases from the
project home page:
https://code.google.com/p/auremo/downloads/list

The packages are here because Google Code have discontinued their download
service as explained here:
http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html

The project home page, wiki, bug database and the Subversion repository
continue to be hosted at Google Code:
https://code.google.com/p/auremo/

There are various other download services which distribute Auremo, as is
their right under the GPL. However the Auremo deveopers are not affiliated
with any of these services and do not endorse them.
